a = "1"

b = 2

print(int(a)+b)

'''
Values in Python can be of different types.
In this exercise the value assigned to a  was of
string type (i.e. text) while the value of b  was
an integer (i.e. whole number) and you cannot add
strings with integers. Therefore we needed to convert
the string to an integer using the int()  built-in
function for the addition operation to be possible.
