'''
The code is supposed to get some input from the user,
but instead it produces an error.
Please try to understand the error and then fix it.


Note: Please use raw_input  instead of input if you are on Python 2.
For Python 3 input  is fine.
'''

#pass = input("Please enter your password: ")

#pass is reserved keyword
#There was a SyntaxError  error because the syntax to name
# the variable was wrong since pass  is a reserved keyword in Python.
# However you can solve
# that by adding a number to the name or simply
# choosing another name for the variable.

pass1 = input("Please enter your password :")
